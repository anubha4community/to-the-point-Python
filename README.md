# to-the-point-Python
Python is not new in the market of programming languages. Although, the spotlight has been thrown on it now!
As a result, a lot of newbies want to start learning it from scratch.
This course is my work and collection from different resources to help learn Python.
The special thing about this course is that I have only included 'extremely required' points and ignored the others, so that any beginner can move to the development part quickly.
If you enjpy reading this course, feel free to fork, download, share and don't forget to give stars and add your comments.
Corrections, if any are most welcome.
